              Pillar Two: Heritability
            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">
              Like a cog in a machine, caste society believed that everyone had a role to perform. This role was assigned at birth and determined everything from high or low status to who you could and couldn’t marry. The predeterminant nature of the caste system is underlined by its aspect of heritability. Different cultures had differing rules on who passed down their caste, in India it was the father but in America it was the mother. The Virginia General Assembly was the first to actually introduce this type of heritability in America. They made it possible for unfaithful men to claim children of enslaved black women. Because no lower caste woman could make claims on a man of higher caste, this went so far as to encourage these men to continue their hierarchical rule. A rule built on exploiting black women. 
              “It is the fixed nature of caste that distinguishes it from class.”
              Your ability to learn, change the way you talk, and adhere to upper class society, were all considered traits of class. While class may have been able to make the lives of those in the lower caste easier, it did not protect them from the atrocities and inequalities created by the caste system. Furthermore, the black and white distinction within the American caste system created an inescapable way to relegate a group based on their skin color. Regardless of class, because the American system tied race into caste standing, it is impossible to be insulated from many atrocities.

              Connection: The Odyssey 
            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">
              The Odyssey gives us a great way to analyze the second pillar, heritability, through Penelope. As the wife of Odysseus she never loses faith and constantly is fighting off suitors. Her hand in marriage is important because marrying Penelope would give the suitor many opportunities for power. The daughter of Icarius of Sparta, her father was a king and a champion. Marrying a daughter from that lineage who was also the wife of Odysseus, bestowed upon the suitor the ability to move up in the world. In the description of the caste we talked a lot about more modern day examples of heritability, but this ancient text gives us a perfect example of heritability in the ancient world. Penelope was not thrown away after Odysseus’ disappearance, but instead gained more power. However, this power gain was temporary, as all of her suitors hoped to take that power away from her and make it their own. She ultimately becomes shackled by this responsibility because marrying her is the only way to rightfully obtain power, something her suitors all desperately want.
