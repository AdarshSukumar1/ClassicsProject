              Race-Craft in Schools 
            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">
              There are many modern interpretations of race, and some are based on religious ideology, or use religion as a basis for their racist ideas. In Texas in 2011, there was a class where they used the Bible to argue racial classification. In this religious interpretation of race, Noah and his three sons were used as a way to classify the different races and the characteristics that came with them. Noah’s sons were named Shem, Ham, and Japeth. According to the course’s textbook, Shem is used to represent “Jews, Semetic People, [and] Oriental Races”, Ham is used to represent African races, and Japeth is used to represent Caucasians.  This was used to instill the idea of African inferiority by arguing that African people were related to Ham and were not as morally pure because of this.  This is the basis of the  “Curse of Ham”, which is a biblical argument that says that God allowed for slavery to arise due to a curse that Noah had placed on Ham for being sinful. Because of Ham’s sins, Africans are perpetually in a state of sin, which leads into ideas of white superiority. This reminded me of the many references to heritability and lineage in this class, as it argues that race is something that you’re born with, and that it gives you certain characteristics.

              Scientific Racism 
            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">
              There are many instances in the modern day of scientific racism, or the idea that race is crafted through biological differences, often pointing to the superiority of one race over others. For example, William B. Hodgson was a linguist in the eighteenth century who argued that people who spoke different languages were of different races. He argued that there were 2 distinct varieties of languages, the Sanscrit and the Hebrew. Hodgson thought that since language was so important to a person’s identity and culture, that those who spoke different languages must be considered to be from different races. He used this to create a distinction between people who spoke Sanscrit and Hebrew by arguing that the Sanskrit speakers were more intelligent than the Hebrew speakers. Hodgson also argued that there was a religious reasoning for race classification, which clearly mimics the rhetoric that we’ve seen in Pillar One of Wilkerson’s 8 pillars of caste, as well as other modern examples like the school in Texas.
