              Pillar Seven: Terror as Enforcement, Cruelty as a Means of Control
            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">
              To enforce a caste system is to enforce that a certain group is beneath all others. This is accomplished through violence and terror, so as to “preempt resistance before it can be imagined.” The upper class need only sit back and watch as everyone else goes along with the rules of the caste system. People in both American and Germany were whipped and hung for small infractions, to instill fear upon the lower caste. The subordinate caste were continually reminded of the power held by the ruling class. The text describes to us that in Nazi Germany, captives were “forced to count each lash as it was inflicted upon them.” In a power play of sorts, the ruling class seared the memory of each whipping into the captives. Reminding them of what could possibly happen if they were to even make the slightest mistake. Infractions that caused this ranged from rolling cigarettes from leaves to trying to add to their rations. Limiting basic freedoms and using fear to dissuade uprising effectively created hopelessness among the lower caste. 
In the US, many criminal laws were not enforced when the infractions occurred against enslaved African Americans. These dangers haunted enslaved America, instilling terror in them. If they were to escape and later captured, their punishment was severe and displayed to the public. In many cases slave owners requested the murder of their escaped slave, setting an example for others who thought to do the same. The public nature of punishment, both in the US as well as in Nazi Germany, that punished even minor offenses are a critical part of the caste system. In some cases they even had the captives exact punishment on each other as the ruling caste simply watched. These horrific practices worked to instill terror and help the ruling caste remain in control.

              Connection: Suppliant Women
            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">
              Aeschylus’s Suppliant Women is a clear exemplification of Pillar 7: Terror as Enforcement, Cruelty as a Means of Control. This is because the play follows Egyptian women and their defiance to the patriarchy. The 50 women flee as they refuse to marry their cousins. They seek refuge in a nearby town under the rule of King Pelasgus, where the people of the town take them in. This play illustrates the horrors of war. As the king of Argos states while pleading to not go to war, “There is no result without grievous hurt”. This can also be connected with heritability, as the King only allowed the women, or the Danaids, to come into town because they were related to Zeus. This illustrates how important lineage was to the ancient Greeks. The ending of the play especially illustrates the idea of violence and its effects, as the women plan to murder these men who they’re forced to marry. This play’s allusion to violence, war, and patriarchy plays into how people are controlled by fear, and how fear is what keeps governments running and certain systems in place.
