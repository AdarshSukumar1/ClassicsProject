              Pillar One: Divine Law and the Laws of Nature
            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">
              The first pillar of caste refers to the ancient Hindu ideology of the separation of social classes due to religious reasons. The writing makes reference to a Buddhist ideology surrounding the creation of the world. In this story, all men were created from one creature, where each part of his body represented a social class and a division of labor that allows people from a society to work together to fulfill the ritual, and economic, needs of the whole. From this story, we get 4 social classes: Brahmans, which represented the head, Rajanya, which represented the arms, Vaishyas, which represented the groin and legs, and the Shudras, who represented the feet. Furthermore, these social castes came with responsibilities. For example, the Shudras, the lowest of the social castes, were the common workers and butchers. Their purpose was to do the dirty work, so that the other castes would not be considered too “impure” to do their ritualistic duties.

              Connection: The Iliad
            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">
              Homer’s Iliad is a perfect example of the first pillar: Divine Law. This is because of the Gods’ ability to change the fate of the hero’s in the text. One clear example of this is Zeus’s constant tampering in the war and the lives of the soldiers. While Zeus claims to remain neutral in the conflict, he regularly helps Hector in battle. In book 7, while Hector and Ajax are fighting, Hector gets hurt and starts bleeding. This is when Zeus steps in, causing the fight to end. In book 11, Zeus also helps Hector by telling him to wait until Agamemnon is hurt before he attacks. This is particularly interesting, as Zeus tries to interfere when the other gods are inserting themselves into the battle, like Hera and Athena. This illustrates a clear distinction between the Gods and the humans, creating a social hierarchy. The idea of “caste” could be connected to the idea of the role of a hero in the text. In ancient India, people did certain jobs for the good of society and in ancient Greece, the heroes fought in order to protect their societies. They both have very clear roles and jobs in their society that they have to do in order to protect others.
